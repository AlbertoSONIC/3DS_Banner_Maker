3DS Banner Maker - snailface
Create custom banner and icon files for your 3ds homebrews.


To replace icons: overwrite the .png in the either one of the 'ctpk' folders and click convert.bat to convert the images. Make sure image dimensions are the same as the folder indicates.

To replace the banner: In the cbmd_banner folder, you have to overwrite the 256x128.png file with an image of your choice. Click convert.bat same as before. Transparency is supported.

To replace the sound effect: Overwrite the example.bcwav file with one of your choice. .wav to bcwav conversion is not supported at this time.

To change display text and setting flags: edit the variables in AppData.txt. Further instructions are inside this document.

To convert everything to .bnr and .icn files: simply click _build_ICNandBNR.bat in the 3DS Banner Maker folder. Next place place these two files in your 3DSTemplate resource folder and compile as usual.
